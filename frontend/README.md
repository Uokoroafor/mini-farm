# Mini-Farm Frontend

## Overview
The **Mini-Farm Frontend** is built with **React** and serves as the client-side application for the **FARM stack** (**FastAPI, React, MongoDB**) to-do application. It interacts with the backend API to provide a responsive user experience. The frontend is integrated with the backend and MongoDB using **Docker Compose** and serves the final build using **Nginx** for production.

## Features
- ⚛️ **React** for building interactive UIs
- 🌐 **Axios** for API communication
- 💅 **CSS/Styled Components/TailwindCSS** for clean, customisable styling
- 📦 **Production-ready builds** served with Nginx
